                <h1>Lamborghini Diablo</h1>
                <p>The Lamborghini Diablo is a high-performance mid-engine sports car produced by the Italian automaker
                    Lamborghini between 1990 and 2001. It was the first production Lamborghini capable of attaining a
                    top speed in excess of 200 miles per hour (320 km/h).</p>
                <p>The Diablo was developed by Lamborghini's engineering team in collaboration with Chrysler, who owned
                    Lamborghini at the time. It was designed by Marcello Gandini of the design house Italdesign, who had
                    previously designed the Lamborghini Countach. The car featured scissor doors, a signature design
                    element of Lamborghini's top-tier models.</p>
                <p>The Diablo was powered by a 5.7 L or 6.0 L V12 engine, depending on the model year, producing between
                    485 to 575 horsepower. It featured a rear-wheel-drive layout and was available with either a manual
                    or automatic transmission.</p>
