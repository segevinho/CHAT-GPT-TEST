                <h1>Lamborghini Aventador</h1>
                <p>The Lamborghini Aventador is a mid-engine sports car produced by the Italian automotive manufacturer
                    Lamborghini. Launched on 28 February 2011 at the Geneva Motor Show, five months after its initial
                    unveiling in Sant'Agata Bolognese, the vehicle, internally codenamed LB834, was designed to replace
                    the ten-year-old Murciélago as the flagship model.</p>
                <p>Named after a fighting bull that earned the Trofeo de la Peña La Madroñera for its courage in the
                    arena in Zaragoza, Spain, in 1993, the Aventador was designed by Filippo Perini. Powered by a 6.5 L
                    (397 cu in) V12 engine, it produces 730 hp (544 kW; 740 PS) at 8,400 rpm and 509 lb⋅ft (690 N⋅m) of
                    torque at 5,500 rpm. Lamborghini's traditional six-speed manual transmission is offered as an
                    option, but only with the Aventador SVJ model.</p>
